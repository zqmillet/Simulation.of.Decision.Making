The simulation object is a chemical reactor control system which is shown as following figure.

This control network contains three layers:

* Management Layer,
* Control Layer,
* Physical Layer.

In the management layer, there are three personal computers and a web server. All the network devices connect to the Ethernet, which connects the internet via a security gateway.

In the control layer, there are three sub networks: Industrial Ethernet 1, 2, 3. In the sub network "Industrial Ethernet 1", three are a engineer state, a data server, and four PLCs. The sub network "Industrial Ethernet 1" connects the management layer via a security gateway. The remaining two sub networks are same as the sub network "Industrial Ethernet 1", so in this section, their details will not be introduced.

In the physical layer, there are a distillation column and two reactor. In the distillation column, the me
